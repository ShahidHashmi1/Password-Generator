## Description

<ul>
<li>
The motivation for this project is to begin the process of not only cataloguing my professional development, but to showcase my skills, projects, and abilities attained in the course of my web development career. 
</li>
<li>
The goal here was to begin my portfolio and have accompanying html and css elements to display what I have learned thus far. It is important to have a focal point for other developers, potential employers, and friends to view my progress as well.
</li>
<li>
This activity is almost the single most important project a web developer can do - a representation of themselves and their body of work.
</li>
</ul>

## Installation

<ol>
<li>
In order to begin this project, we must first have a code viewer - could be something like Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
</li>
<li>
Since we are building up our portfolio from scratch, it is important that we creat two starter files for this directory. We need an html file for the code, and a css file for the stylistic elements. 
</li>
<li>
As a good practice, it is typically best to complete the subject matter (just the html) of this project before doing any styling. Once we have our structure of what the web page will look like, then we are able to add in styling functionality.
</li>
<li>
Periodically making sure these updates and changes look correct in a live broswer is very important as well. Have a browser open to see the updates happening, and you will receive a sort of visual feedback to tell what needs to be done next. 
</li>
</ol>

## Credits

The collaborators on this project included cohort member, Achilles, instructor Eric Weiss, and TA Michael Kotte. 

The resources for this portfolio to reaffirm knowledge on semantic html as well as CSS styling were through [W3 Schools][1]. I drew a lot of inspiration from looking over other developer portfolios and seeing where they put their flex boxes, what colors they used, etc. That inspiration came from sites like [Hostinger-Tutorials][2] and [Alvarotrigo][3]. Lastly and as always, [Youtube][4] was a great resource for me personally when having issues with my flex boxes doing what they needed to be doing.
