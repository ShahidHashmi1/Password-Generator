## Description

<ul>
<li>
The motivation for this project was to create an easy UI platform where users can generate a random password with specified perameters (special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and/ or numbers). 
</li>
<li>
The goal here was to make a nice looking page with very simple prompts, easy-to-read styling, and ease of use for the end-user.
</li>
<li>
This code can be modified to meet other perameters, but the main constants are that the password must be between 8 and 128 characters AND contain at least one of the specified criteria for the actual characters generated. 
</li>
<li>
It is an excellent baseline for providing non-bias and completely randomly generated passwords that will not be easy to replicate or guess!
</li>
</ul>

## Installation

<ol>
<li>
In order to begin this project, we must first have a code viewer - such as Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
</li>
<li>
Since we are relying heavily on the javascript here, it is important that we have the appropriate html code with proper IDs and classes labelled so that our javascript can funtion properly in use and in console.  
</li>
<li>
Periodically making sure the project's updates and changes look correct in a live broswer is very important as well. Having a browser open to see the updates happening in live-time will allow you to receive a sort of visual feedback to tell what needs to be done next - outside of solely relying on what the code looks like.
</li>
</ol>

## Credits

The collaborators on this project included my tutor, Sabrina Hanson, and my TA, Michael Kotte.

The resources for this portfolio to reaffirm knowledge on semantic html as well as CSS styling were through [W3 Schools][1]. I drew a lot of inspiration from looking over other developer portfolios and seeing where they put their flex boxes, what colors they used, etc. That inspiration came from sites like [Hostinger-Tutorials][2] and [Alvarotrigo][3]. Lastly and as always, [Youtube][4] was a great resource for me personally when having issues with my flex boxes doing what they needed to be doing.
